        Pelagic Habitats Assessments
    </h2>
    <p>
        Phytoplankton zooplankton form the base of marine pelagic food webs and directly or indirectly support fish, shellfish, 
        and seabirds. Because of their short life cycles and sensitivity to nutrients, temperature, salinity, and 
        hydrographic conditions, they respond rapidly to environmental change. These environmental drivers reflect both 
        natural climatic variability and anthropogenic pressures such as nutrient enrichment.

            PH3: Changes in Phytoplankton and Zooplankton Communities 
        </h3>
    <p>
        Pelagic Habitat Indicator 2 (PH2) evaluates changes in phytoplankton biomass and zooplankton abundance, 
        using copepods as a representative zooplankton group. It identifies statistically significant increases, decreases, 
        or no change by comparing a pre-2015 baseline period with 2015-2019 data. The assessment is conducted at a regional 
        scale across OSPAR Regions II, III, and IV using COMP4 units. PH2 detects anomalies relative to natural variability 
        and helps interpret potential impacts on ecosystem structure and functioning.
    </p>
        <h3>
            PH3: Changes in Phytoplankton and Zooplankton Communities (PH2)
        </h3>
    <p>
        Pelagic Habitat Indicator 3 (PH3) focuses on changes in plankton lifeforms to 
        assess community-level responses to environmental pressures. It examines both short-term fluctuations and long-term
        trends that may signal ecosystem shifts. At the North-East Atlantic scale, plankton changes are closely linked to
        water column characteristics such as depth, stratification, and freshwater influence. Together, 
        PH2 and PH3 provide complementary insights into spatial and temporal patterns of environmental 
        change in pelagic habitats.
